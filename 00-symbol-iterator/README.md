## Symbols and Private Properties

Read [A Practical Guide to Symbols in JavaScript](https://thecodebarbarian.com/a-practical-guide-to-symbols-in-javascript.html).

> Symbols are a great tool for representing internal state in objects while ensuring that user data stays separate from program state. 

> With symbols, there's no more need for conventions like prefixing program state properties with '`$`'. **So next time you find yourself setting an object property to `$$__internalFoo`, consider using a symbol instead**.

## Summary of Symbols

- Objects that can be used in `for..of` are called **iterables**.

- Iterables must implement the method named `Symbol.iterator`.

- The result of `obj[Symbol.iterator]()` is called an **iterator**. It handles further iteration process.

- An iterator must have the method named `next()` that returns an object 
  - `{done: Boolean, value: any}`, here `done:true` denotes the end of the iteration process, 
  - otherwise the value is the **next** `value`.

- The `Symbol.iterator` method is called automatically by `for..of`, but we also can do it directly.

- Built-in iterables like strings or arrays, also implement `Symbol.iterator`.

- String iterator knows about surrogate pairs. See my notes on [JS and UTF-16 and Problems Processing Strings](https://ull-esit-pl.netlify.app/temas/expresiones-regulares-y-analisis-lexico/unicode-utf-16-and-js.html#js-and-utf-16-and-problems-processing-strings)

- Objects that have indexed properties and `length` are called *array-like*. Such objects may also have other properties and methods, but lack the built-in methods of arrays.

- Most built-in methods assume that they work with iterables or array-likes instead of **real** arrays, because thatâ€™s more abstract.

- `Array.from(obj[, mapFn, thisArg])` makes a real Array from an iterable or array-like obj, and we can then use array methods on it. The optional arguments `mapFn` and `thisArg` allow us to apply a function to each item.
